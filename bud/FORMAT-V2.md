# B.U.D. 2.0 Container Format - the .bud v2 spec (2026-08-16)

This document is the BYTE-LEVEL contract of the `.bud` v2 container and its chunk encoders.
Goal: an open, structured, machine-readable format (K72 - Data Act compliance) with verifier
tests (K38). The document and the tests together form the format's proof chain.

## 1. General principles

- **Losslessness completeness:** `restore(store(d)) == d` for EVERY d (including corrupt input).
- **Deterministic:** the same input -> the same bytes (a dedup/proof anchor).
- **Bomb protection:** every size field is bounded by ceilings (K25/K38).
- **Panic-free:** no parse path panics; corrupt input -> an error (None/Err).
- **Type independence:** the structural chunking type does NOT affect losslessness, only chunk
  granularity (dedup/proof efficiency).

## 2. BudV2File - the full file layout (little-endian)

```
+0   [8]  magic:        \xB5 0x55 0x44 0xB0 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00
                         (high-bit prefix: it cannot be confused with file(1)/ASCII - S.47)
+8   [2]  codec:        u16 - the FormatCodec registry code (1=Json 2=Csv 3=Log 4=Text
                         10=Mp4 11=Jpeg 12=Png 16=Pdf 0=Unknown)
+10  [34] multihash:    [1] algo (0x16=SHA3-256) + [1] length (32) + [32] digest
+44  [4]  chunk_count:  u32 (ceiling: 1_000_000)
+48  [8]  total_len:    u64 - the total length of the chunk data (the STORED bytes)
+56  [1]  chunk_codec:  u8 - 0=Raw, 1=Huffman (ChunkCodec; unknown -> refused)
+57  [4]  count:        u32 - the chunk count (must equal header.chunk_count)
+61  ...  chunks:       each one:
         +0 [8]  len:   u64 - the chunk data length (ceiling: 64 MiB)
         +8 [32] cid:   content_id (SHA3-256, see below)
         +40[L]  data:  len bytes of chunk data (Raw is raw; Huffman is compressed)
```
Total length: `57 + 4 + sum(40 + len_i)`. Trailing bytes -> STRICT REFUSAL (tamper detection).

### content_id (K3/K31)
```
SHA3-256("BDLM_CONTENT_V1" || u64_le(length) || bytes)
```
- The root: `SHA3-256("BDLM_BUD_V2" || cid_0 || cid_1 || ... || cid_n)` - header.content_id.digest.
- A chunk cid is always computed over the STORED bytes (Raw: raw; Huffman: compressed).
- **The K31 decision (2026-08-16):** 32 bytes (SHA3-256) is KEPT - 256-bit collision resistance,
  about 128-bit post-quantum security (Grover halves it), and it fits the dedup index/proof size.
  If an upgrade to 48-64 B (SHA3-384/512, BLAKE3) is needed it is done through the `MultiHash.algo`
  field (K34): a reader REFUSES an unknown algo, the format does not break.

## K60 zero egress (the business model)

Access INSIDE the network (the same B.U.D. network / CDN / peer) has zero egress; only leaving to
the Internet is charged (`EgressZone`, `egress_cost`, `holds_egress`). Egress is not added to the
storage cost - access to user data is free (the R2-like zero-egress advantage).

### Verification (decode)
1. magic, the version bit, algo == 0x16 -> otherwise refused.
2. An unknown chunk_codec -> refused.
3. chunk_count > 1_000_000 -> refused; len > 64 MiB -> refused; total > 4 GiB -> refused.
4. In EVERY chunk `content_id(data) != cid` -> refused (payload tampering).
5. `sum(len_i) != total_len` or `count != chunk_count` -> refused.
6. If the root digest does not match -> refused.

## 3. ChunkCodec::Huffman - BUD-HFM1 (bud_format_huffman)

```
+0 [8] magic:  \xB5 'H' 'F' 'M' '1' 0x00 0x00 0x00
+8 [1] version: 1
+9 [8] original length: u64 (ceiling: 4 GiB)
+17[2] symbol count: u16 (n)
+19    table: n x { [1] symbol, [1] code length }   (a repeated symbol -> refused)
+body: canonical Huffman codes, MSB-first bit packing
```
- Code lengths: canonical assignment ordered by (length, symbol) (DEFLATE-like).
- If the Kraft inequality is violated -> refused; a code length > 32 -> refused.
- A single symbol -> length 1; empty input -> n=0, an empty body.
- The padding bits of the last byte are free; decoding stops once the original length is reached.

## 4. Structural chunking (structural_split, K38)

- **Json:** delimiters are embedded into the chunks; a depth-1 comma is a boundary and is kept at
  the start of the NEXT chunk (`start = i`). Even if it is not an array or is malformed, a single
  chunk -> lossless.
- **Csv/Log/Text:** `split_inclusive('\n')` - every chunk ends with a line break.
- **Binary:** fixed 64 KiB blocks.
- **Joining:** PURE concatenation - no `[`/`]` is added for any type.
- **Compaction (K35):** adjacent chunks below min_chunk are merged (losslessly).

## 5. Format detection (bud_format_pipe::detect)

The order: JSON (starts with `[`/`{`) -> CSV (commas + lines) -> LOG (a 4-digit year on the first
line) -> Text (it contains lines or is entirely printable ASCII) -> Unknown (binary).
A wrong match is safe: losslessness is independent of the type (Section 1).

## 6. Backwards compatibility and evolution

- The v2 magic carries the v2 code; `from_bytes` requires an exact match.
- To add a new format code, `FormatCodec` and `bud_format_registry.rs` are updated together.
- To add a new chunk encoder, `ChunkCodec::from_u8` is extended (refusing the unknown is deliberate
  forward compatibility: an old reader refuses a new encoder rather than corrupting).
- The IMPLEMENTATION of this spec is the `bud_format_container` tests (roundtrip, tampering, bombs,
  a mini-fuzz); if the spec changes the tests must change too (the proof chain).

### 6.1 Public API changes that break callers

The `bud_core` crate sits on the 0.x line, so a breaking change is allowed but is written down here
with what a downstream caller has to do.

- `PdfStreamSplit::decode` returns `Option<Vec<u8>>` (it returned `Vec<u8>`). `None` means the
  split's offsets do not fit its text, which only a hand-built or forged split can produce;
  `from_blob` already refused such offsets, so a split that came off the wire cannot reach `None`.
  Callers that previously wrote `split.decode()` now handle the `None` arm the same way they handle
  a `from_blob` refusal: refuse the blob, do not pad or guess.
- `TenantMultifileStore` deltas open with a framing version byte (`DELTA_VERSION`, `0x10`), and a
  changed block is framed as `0x01 || len (u32 LE) || block`. `apply_delta` refuses a delta whose
  first byte is not that version. A delta written by the earlier framing (`0x01 || block`, the
  length implied by the chunk size, no version byte) starts with a block marker and is refused
  rather than decoded under the new rule; no such delta was ever stored on chain (the multifile
  blob carries chunks and chunk lists, deltas were only ever a return value), so no reader for it
  is kept. A caller holding one recomputes it with `add_delta` from the two versions.
- The engine shard pack (`engine_store(.., erasure = true)`) carries a SHA3-256 digest in front of
  every shard (`BDLM_BUD_SHARD_V1`, 32 bytes, before the 4-byte length). `open_shard_pack` reads any
  four shards whose digest still matches and refuses a pack with fewer than four; a pack written
  without the digests is refused. There is no deployed pack in the old layout (the engine and its
  erasure flag are not on any storage deal yet), so no migration is provided; a caller holding one
  re-stores from the original bytes.

## 8. Lossless JSON columnar transform (bud_format_columnar, an invention - 2026-08-16)

A transform BEFORE compression: an array of JSON records is split into column arrays (the values of
the same key become adjacent -> zstd sees the repetitions). Two modes:
- **Exact (mode 0):** the columns stay in the original record order -> `decode(encode(d)) == d`
  BYTE FOR BYTE (K38). Key order is preserved via serde preserve_order.
- **OrderFree (mode 1):** the records are sorted deterministically -> the record SET is preserved
  (KF2); the sorting gain depends on the corpus (an extra gain with repeated key values).

The blob layout: magic `\xB5COL` + version + mode + key count + (len,key)* + record count
+ (len,value)* + a SHA3-256 digest (the "BDLM_BUD_COLUMNAR_V1" domain) - tampering is REFUSED.
Measurement (seed=7, 50k records, zstd19): RAW 7.83x -> Exact 8.53x -> OrderFree 11.49x.
Irregular JSON (records with different key sets) -> None; the pipeline falls back to the raw path
(losslessness is preserved). Ceilings: MAX_RECORDS 10M, MAX_COLUMNS 256, MAX_VALUE_BYTES 1 MiB.

## 9. The production ratio proof (bud_format_production, an invention - 2026-08-16)

Every .bud may carry a `BudProductionRecord` at production time:
`{format_codec, pipe, original_len, stored_len, payload_root(=content_id(original)), ts, claimed_ratio}`
- `record_hash()` = SHA3("BDLM_BUD_PRODUCTION_V1" || fields) - it can be written to the chain.
- `verify()`: claimed_ratio is approximately original_len/stored_len (tolerance 0.01); an invalid
  value is REFUSED.
- `ProductionGates::k_bud_production(rec, measured)`: if the claim exceeds 1.5x the measurement
  table it is REFUSED (K19) - unmeasured claims such as "17.19x" CANNOT PASS the production proof.
- CLI: `bud produce-proof -i x.bud --pipe <pipe>`.

The economic link: the $0.016/TB/month commitment is bound to the REAL ratio in the production
proof; if the ratio is insufficient the price is revised (an honest contract). The current honest
price: 0.23342 x 1.143 / 8.53 = about $0.031/TB/month (Exact columnar, a single file).

## 7. Measurements (2026-08-16 - REPRODUCIBLE with `cargo run --release --bin measure_ratios -- --seed 7`)

A deterministic corpus: 50k JSON records / 60k CSV lines / 80k LOG lines (seed=7).
These values are identical to the runner's inline measurement (verified). The old table's
8.48x/5.51x/7.68x values came from a different, non-reproducible corpus - by K19 honesty they were
replaced with verified values (EK13).

| Pipeline | Verified ratio |
|---|---|
| structural+zstd19 JSON | 7.83x |
| structural+xz9 JSON | 8.07x |
| structural+zstd19 CSV | 3.55x |
| structural+zstd19 LOG | 6.17x |
| structural+xz9 LOG | 6.30x |
| BUD-HFM1 (the built-in Huffman, log) | ~1.69x (a 13.98 MB sample, CLI evidence) |
| ZSTD-19 container (ChunkCodec::Zstd, log) | ~6.55x (a 10.48 MB sample, CLI --zstd evidence) |
| JSON columnar Exact (zstd19) | 8.53x (seed=7, 50k) - the invention transform |
| JSON columnar OrderFree (zstd19) | 11.49x (seed=7, 50k; if record order is free) |

The 17.19x JSON claim DOES NOT HOLD against these measurements (the K19 canary: 7.83x < 17.19x);
the $0.016/TB/month ceiling requires 17.02x for the selected wide code (18+3), e=1.1667
(it required 18.76x while the code was EVENODD p=7, e=1.286) and 16.68x for flat 7+1 (1.143).
