//! Provider-side emit path: bytes in, QR feed out, with the ceilings checked
//! before any of them is paid for.
//!
//! The stages below `src/storage` each refuse on their own terms: the carousel
//! caps `k`, the frame header caps the wire, the matrix caps a QR symbol, the
//! provider refuses a transport derivative as a body. Nothing stood at the
//! front of that queue and answered the operator's actual question, which is
//! not "does `encode_qr_video` compile" but "what will this cost me, what will
//! the viewer hold, and do the two agree".
//!
//! `qr_feed_preview` is that front seat. It measures the request against every
//! ceiling, encodes once, reassembles what a viewer would reassemble from those
//! frames, re-emits frame zero from the recipe alone and compares, and reports
//! the commitments a publish would pin. It also runs the durable step against a
//! scratch `InMemoryStorageProvider`: the receipt it reports is the receipt a
//! publish returns, and the refusal it reports for the video blob is the refusal
//! a publish would raise. The scratch store is discarded with the preview, which
//! is the point - the node does not select a provider at startup, so this path
//! must not need one to answer.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! It does not authorise anything. Both entry points take their bytes from the
//! caller and publish no handle into stored content, so there is no viewer here
//! to grant: the grant and Pollen checks belong to whichever path reads content
//! out of a registry, and adding a second copy of that registry here would give
//! the answer twice and let the two disagree.
