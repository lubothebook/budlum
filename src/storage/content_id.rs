//! B.U.D. content addressing.
//!
//! Vision §8.2 originally proposed a *double-hash* `ContentId` carrying both
//! An IPFS multihash and a Poseidon4 hash. The Poseidon primitive is not
//! Wired into `budlum-core` (it lives in `BudZKVM`), so we use the
//! Existing domain-separated SHA-256 (`hash_fields_bytes`) with the
//! `BDLM_CONTENT_V1` domain tag. This is exactly the same trade-off the Tur
//! 14 plan §3.1 makes:
//!
//! > "Content addressing: the `ContentId` type, based on a Poseidon4 hash - the
//! >  same family as the `poseidon4_hash` primitive already used in BudZero, so no new
//! >  hash fonksiyonu icat etme)."
//!
//! We are not inventing a new hash. We use the existing one and tag it
//! So it can never collide with another 32-byte field that happens to be
//! Hashed the same way in a different module.
//!
//! Plan §0.5 (data-sovereignty / team-independence rule),
//! `ContentId` is a **pure on-chain data shape** - no network calls, no
//! "Budlum Inc. indexer" dependency, no admin/pause hook. Any independent
//! Node can compute it from the raw chunk bytes alone.
