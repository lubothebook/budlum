//! View grants: who may open content that is not public.
//!
//! # Product placement
//!
//! - **B.U.D. 3.0 (Three / R1):** the durable object is a recipe. A view-key
//!   unlocks *production* (or decryption of an encrypted recipe blob), not a
//!   stored body. QR frames stay derivative-only.
//! - **B.U.D. 2.0 (Classic body / R2-R3 cost regimes):** the durable object is
//!   held bytes. Privacy is **client-side encryption**
//!   ([`crate::storage::ContentEncryption::ClientSide`]) plus this grant layer
//!   for key delivery. Operators hold ciphertext; they do not hold the key.
//!
//! R2/R3 in the cost tables are **not** a third edition. They are body-cost
//! regimes on the Classic path. If it has a body, it is 2.0 (Classic). If it
//! is recipe-only with zero held bytes, it is 3.0 (Three). Calling a stored
//! JPEG "3.0 because we wrapped it in QR" is a category error (K13).
//!
//! # What a grant is
//!
//! A grant is an on-chain record: `(content, grantee, key_id, policy)` with an
//! open epoch and optional revoke epoch. The **key material is never stored
//! here** - putting a key in a public commitment publishes the key. Delivery
//! is out of band (DM, device keystore, sealed channel). This registry only
//! answers: "does grantee G still have permission to use `key_id` K on content C?"
//!
//! # Revocation honesty
//!
//! Revoke means **no new opens**. Bytes or frames already on a device are not
//! clawed back. Product copy that says otherwise is a lie (threat model T3).
//!
//! # ZKVM / TEE (research pin, not implemented here)
//!
//! - **ZK** proves a statement about committed data without revealing it
//!   (Filecoin PoRep/PoSt compress storage proofs; they do not make plaintext
//!   private if the client uploaded plaintext). Confidentiality of *content*
//!   still requires client encryption first.
//! - **TEE** can decrypt or evaluate inside an enclave (attestation). Trust is
//!   the chip vendor + side-channel history (SGX breaks are real). Our
//!   `tee_attestation` module signs quotes; vendor chain verify is unwired
//!   (no trust root).
//! - **Hybrid (industry default 2025-26):** chain holds commitments + grants;
//!   ZK for public verifiability of proofs; TEE optional for private compute.
//!   Validity of a proof ≠ authorization to view (Aleo/snarkVM lesson).
