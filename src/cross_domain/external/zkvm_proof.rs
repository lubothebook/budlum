//! A domain whose finality is *proven*, not voted: the BudZKVM adapter.
//!
//! WIRING: wired - like every adapter in this tree, it is reachable through
//! registry admission (`AdapterSpec::ZkVm` in the consensus-resident intake)
//! plus the finality dispatch documented in `domain_bridge`.
//!
//! # Why this adapter exists
//!
//! Every other adapter in this tree reads a vote - a committee signed, a
//! validator set justified, an authority set asserted. A vote has an honesty
//! assumption attached to it, and the profile has to say so.
//!
//! This one does not. A BudZKVM proof is checked by the chain's own STARK
//! verifier against the public inputs the program committed to. There is no
//! committee to be honest or dishonest, no bond to slash, no window to
//! challenge. `TrustModel::Trustless` is not a claim about the external
//! system's politics here; it is a statement about what the verification
//! actually requires.
//!
//! That difference is why this adapter is the one the framework was built
//! around: it is the case where "permissionless" is literally true, because
//! Budlum decides nothing about who produced the proof and everything about
//! whether the proof is valid.
//!
//! # What the verifier is asked to do
//!
//! The envelope, the public inputs and the program all travel together, and
//! all three are passed to the verifier. That is deliberate. A proof verified
//! against public inputs the caller chose would prove nothing about the state
//! root it attests to, and a proof verified against a program the caller chose
//! would prove nothing about which computation ran. The three-way binding -
//! envelope, inputs, program - is the whole guarantee, and every probe below
//! attacks one edge of it.
//!
//! # What this adapter refuses to do
//!
//! It does not produce proofs. Producing a proof is the prover's job
//! (`src/prover`), and an adapter that could also mint proofs would be a
//! verifier that trusts itself.
