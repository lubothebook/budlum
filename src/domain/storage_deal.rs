//! B.U.D. storage deals and retrieval challenges (
//! Vision §8.5).
//!
//! **Production boundary:** the BudZKVM `VerifyMerkle` 64-depth soundness gate
//! Is still treated as incomplete for mainnet claims. Every `open_deal` requires
//! A structurally valid `ProofEnvelope` plus `storage_root`, and challenge answers
//! Bind that envelope to chain/deal/challenge context, but this module must not
//! Market the result as full Proof-of-Storage until the independent proof gate is
//! Closed.
//!
//! Two availability/proof layers currently coexist:
//!
//! 1. **Merkle envelope binding:** every `open_deal` requires a
//!    `merkle_proof` and `storage_root`; the chain validates envelope shape and
//!    Replay-domain binding. This is a devnet hardening gate, not a mainnet
//!    Durability claim.
//!
//! 2. **Retrieval Challenge:** the interim retrieval challenge remains
//!    As an anti-unresponsiveness mechanism. An operator can pass by holding only
//!    The requested byte range - it does NOT prove full storage. Treat
//!    Slashing-from-missed-challenge as a "this operator is unresponsive" signal,
//!    NOT as a "this operator is destroying provable storage" signal.
//!
//! Data-sovereignty rule (plan §0.5): anyone (any account, no
//! Role required) may open a `RetrievalChallenge` and may submit a
//! `StorageDeal`. There is no team-gated "official monitor" role.
//!
//! WIRING: wired - the durability half of this module is driven from
//! `run_storage_maintenance` in `src/chain/chain_actor.rs`: the per-object
//! repair margin from `objects_below_own_repair_margin`, the shard view from
//! `under_replicated_shards`, the repair action from
//! `open_repair_tickets_for_free_slots`, and the placement advisory from
//! `annotate_expected_holders`. Re-derive before trusting this paragraph -
//! a wiring note is a claim with an expiry date, not a property of the text it
//! sits next to.
