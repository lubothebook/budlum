//! B.U.D. storage writes as signed, in-block transactions.
//!
//! The storage registry is hashed into the account state root
//! (`AccountState::calculate_state_root` folds `storage_registry.root()`), so
//! a write to it is a consensus write. Until this module every write reached
//! the registry through a local RPC command on one node, out of block, which
//! is why the chain actor refuses every storage command on mainnet: two
//! honest nodes would end up with different state roots.
//!
//! This family moves those writes into the block. Each variant is applied by
//! the executor's `Storage` arm, inside block execution, from a transaction
//! the sender signed. It has four variants: manifest registration, the
//! operator class declaration, the self-host policy declaration and opening a
//! deal. Challenges and coding audits follow in their own steps, so each one
//! lands with its own tests.
