//! The tree is written in English, except for the Turkish README.
//!
//! The repository was translated to English over many passes. A translation
//! pass that is not gated regresses: a new comment, a new test name or a new
//! error message written in Turkish is invisible to review because nothing
//! fails, and the tree drifts back one line at a time.
//!
//! # What is allowed to stay Turkish
//!
//! Exactly three things (plus the owner's directive documents named in
//! [`ALLOWED_FILES`], and the Turkish agent definitions under
//! `.claude/agents/`, which are the owner's directive in agent form):
//!
//!   * [`ALLOWED_FILES`] - `README.tr.md` is a deliberate translation for
//!     Turkish readers and is published as such.
//!   * [`ALLOWED_DIRS`] - a Turkish localisation directory. The strings shown
//!     to a Turkish user ARE the product there; translating them into English
//!     would delete the feature rather than clean the tree.
//!   * The word "Türkçe" itself, wherever it appears. It is the label on the
//!     link that points at that README, so banning it would ban the link.
//!
//! Everything else is a finding.
//!
//! # Why a ratchet and not a ban
//!
//! The translation is not finished. Measured at the time of writing: 5738
//! lines across 346 files still carry Turkish. A gate that fails on all of
//! them fails on every commit and gets switched off, which is worse than no
//! gate. So this has the same shape as `udeps` and `no-idle-code`: the files
//! that still carry Turkish are recorded in [`BASELINE_PATH`] with their line
//! counts, and the gate fails when
//!
//!   * a file **not on the baseline** gains a Turkish line, or
//!   * a file on the baseline gains **more** Turkish lines than recorded.
//!
//! The baseline only shrinks. A file whose count drops is reported so the
//! recorded number is lowered in the same change, and a file that reaches zero
//! must leave the list. That way finishing the translation is the only way the
//! gate stays green, and no pass can quietly regress.
//!
//! # Why two signals rather than one
//!
//! A Turkish-character scan alone is not enough: the tree already contains
//! Turkish written without diacritics (`kanit`, `dogrulama`, `olculen`), which
//! is exactly what a hurried translation leaves behind. That class was measured
//! in this tree and it is the class a character scan misses.
//!
//! So there are two:
//!
//!   1. **Characters.** Any of `şğıçöüŞĞİÇÖÜ`. Unambiguous.
//!   2. **Words.** A vocabulary of Turkish words that do not collide with
//!      English. Words that are spelled the same in both languages (`test`,
//!      `var`, `son`, `kok`, `dal`, `bos`, `once`) are deliberately absent: a
//!      gate that fires on `once` teaches people to disable it.
//!
//! # A green gate is only as wide as its vocabulary
//!
//! The word list started at 60 entries and the gate was green, which was read
//! as "the tree has 9 Turkish lines left in 3 files". It did not. A scan with
//! a wider list of undiacriticised Turkish found **121 further lines in 86
//! files** that the gate walked straight past: `kilidi`, `satir`, `icin`,
//! `sadece`, `derleme`, `kapisi` and the rest of the everyday vocabulary a
//! hurried translation leaves behind. The gate was not wrong about what it
//! looked for; it was never asked to look for those.
//!
//! This is the failure mode of every list-driven gate: the report says
//! "clean", and what it means is "clean, as far as the list goes". So the
//! vocabulary is now 157 entries, and the entries were chosen by measuring the
//! tree rather than by guessing - each one was counted, and each surviving
//! collision with English is handled by [`ENGLISH_COLLISIONS`] rather than by
//! dropping the Turkish word and reopening the hole.
//!
//! # Why proper nouns are scrubbed first
//!
//! `Gröbner`, `Schrödinger` and `Poincaré` carry diacritics that are not
//! Turkish. They are removed from the line before the character scan, or the
//! gate would report a mathematician as a translation defect.
