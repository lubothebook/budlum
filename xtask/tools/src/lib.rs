// Unsafe lock: this crate currently has 0 unsafe. The moment an `unsafe` block
// enters, the build FAILs (a regression gate). The same policy as the main crate.
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Repository tools, in Rust.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists
//!
//! `xtask/gates` moved the gates from shell to Rust and states its reasoning in
//! its own header. The same reasoning holds for scripts that are **not gates**,
//! and at one point it holds more strongly: when a gate falls CI turns red and
//! somebody looks; a tool silently doing the wrong thing is visible to nobody.
//!
//! Three shell failures measured in this tree:
//!
//!   * `set -u` catches an **unassigned** variable, it does not catch an
//!     **empty** one. With `VAR=""`, `rm -rf "$VAR/"` runs. `ShellCheck`
//!     carries an open feature request for this class and it was not closed.
//!   * `grep -q` asks "does this text occur"; the right question is usually
//!     "what is this value". In this tree a wrongly scaled ratio and a stale
//!     factor passed two separate gates for exactly this reason.
//!   * There is no type between a path, a number and a label; a script that
//!     compares the wrong two things compiles and runs.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Every tool is a module, every module has a `run` function returning
//! `Result<String, String>`. The `Ok` side is the successful output itself,
//! the `Err` side is the finding. No tool calls `process::exit` from inside,
//! so each of them can be called from a test.
//!
//! # Migration order
//!
//! The scripts are moved one by one, not in a single step. In the first round
//! the four that **no workflow calls** go over: `run_nodes.sh`,
//! `pre-push-check.sh`, `generate_zkvm_seed_corpus.sh` and
//! `backup_restore_drill.sh`. Converting these cannot break CI, because CI
//! does not call them anyway.
//!
//! Moved in the second round: the five scripts called from workflows
//! (`audit-deps`, `generate-sbom`, `smoke_rpc`, `docker-smoke-mainnet`,
//! `devnet-multinode-smoke`), each together with its own workflow change. Their
//! modules are `audit_deps`, `sbom`, `smoke_rpc`, `docker_smoke` and
//! `multinode_smoke`; `rpc` and `json` are the std-only HTTP and JSON helpers
//! they share.
//! `coverage-report.sh` was not called and parsed `cargo llvm-cov` output; its
//! counterpart is the `module-coverage` gate in `xtask/gates`, and the script
//! is gone.

/// not a workspace, so `[workspace]` cannot be the marker.
